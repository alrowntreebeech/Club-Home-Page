Second project - testing out resposive design. 
Really struggled with this as I was trying out grids - however they did not respond how I wanted them to when using the **device toolbar** on chrome developer tools.
I did only focus on changing the viewport from UHD to large screen and didn't focus the website on anything smaller as I would have spend a hours doing it.
